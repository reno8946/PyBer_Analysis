# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those disparities can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to implement new business policies.

## PyBer Analysis Results
When looking at the pyber summary table created at the end of deliverable one, you'll notice that there is an inverse relationship between the total fares and average fare per ride and average fare per driver. As the total fares increase, the average fares decrease, while alternatively the total fares increase as the total rides and total drivers increase as demonstrated in the table as you go from rural cities to urban cities.

When looking at the multiple line graph that was created for deliverable two, you'll notice that the total fares for each city type see slight peaks and drops on a weekly basis, but nothing signifant, as there are clear disparities in profits by city type, with urban acquiring the most and rural acquiring the least. Because there are smaller populations in rural and suburban areas compared to urban cities, it's expected that there would naturally be more drivers and demand from passengers as a result, hence the differences as you move into the less populated suburban areas and then into the even lesser populated and geographically disparate rural cities. However, there may be ways to challenge these disparities, which are addressed in the summary.

## PyBer Analysis Summary

Overall, there were drastic differences in total fares by city type with urban cities having the highest fares and rural cities having the lowest total fares. One potential solution is lowering the fare for rural riders, so the demand goes up and ultimately the total fares for rural towns. Additionally, there could be company or government subsidies or added bonuses and incentives for each passenger picked up in a rural area, so that the drivers get more profits while keeping the fares lower for passengers. Finally, PyBer could invest more into rural areas to create jobs with good wages, so that people in those areas have the money and reason to use their services in rural cities. PyBer could also try to create more public transportation friendly suburbs and rural areas by promoting car-pooling and providing benefits and incentives to passengers in these towns for each time they use the app. Rural areas and suburban cities have more demand than supply, so therefore more push and incentives need to be created in order for the supply of drivers in those areas to increase.
