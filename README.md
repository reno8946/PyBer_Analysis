# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those disparities can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to implement new business policies.

## PyBer Analysis Summary

Overall, there were drastic differences in total fares by city type with urban cities having the highest fares and rural cities having the lowest total fares. One potential solution is lowering the fare for rural riders, so the demand goes up and ultimately the total fares for rural towns. Additionally, there could be company or government subsidies or added bonuses and incentives for each passenger picked up in a rural area, so that the drivers get more profits while keeping the fares lower for passengers. Finally, PyBer could invest more into rural areas to create jobs with good wages, so that people in those areas have the money and reason to use their services in rural cities. PyBer could also try to create more public transportation friendly suburbs and rural areas by promoting car-pooling and providing benefits and incentives to passengers in these towns for each time they use the app.
